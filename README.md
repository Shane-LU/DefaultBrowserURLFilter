# DefaultBrowserURLFilter
DefaultBrowserURLFilter

Current it's still working in progress. 

To use the program: 
1) build the program
2) Run "defaultbrowserfilter.exe -Install"
3) In control panel -> Default Programs -> Set your default programs, you could find the "DefaultBrowserURLFilter" in the list. And we could select "Choose defaults for this program" to set http/https as its default.  (This could be automatic, but this will rely on a private microsoft hash algorithm)
4) Whenever we click a URL the defaultbrowserfilter.exe will be launched.
